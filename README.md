#### Abstract
Broadway musical theatre is not a ephemeral and New York local phenomenon. It is a powerful brand, and a form of cultural export, which through international touring and international productions, has created a global network of audience.

This project follows Broadway musical titles through its lifetime, its Broadway performance, and international touring across continents to visualize the dynamics of cultural transmission, and more importantly to understand the motivation behind this global distribution. The research aims to discover a better way for producers and authors of Broadway shows to branch out into foreign markets, for presenters to more effectively assess the competitive landscape and market interest for Broadway musical titles.
