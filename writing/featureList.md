### Feature List
#### Attribute Clustering 
This allows user to group titles based on adaptation (whether a musical is adapted from a source book or film), genre (......), critical acclaim (whether a musical has won or been nominated for a Tony Awards), and gender of leading cast (female or male). This feature invites the user to compare & contrast by different group attributes and explore any underlying trends for the global distribution of Broadway musicals. 

#### Mouse Action - Hover Effect
The user can hover over a title circle for a focused view of the geographical distribution of this musical. Similarly, hovering over a location circle will also bring up the portfolio of musical titles presented or performed at this location. This effect will also fade any irrelavent information to the hovering title or location, hence reducing noise and providing a clearer perspective. 

#### Mouse Action - Click & Timeline View
With this feature, the user is able to see the entire context for a specific title's performance history but also quickly drill down on specific periods of time. The timeline perspective simulates the passing of time relatively fluidly, visualizing the growth of the title's popularity across time (especially after its Broadway run), and any seasonal pattern in its lifetime.
